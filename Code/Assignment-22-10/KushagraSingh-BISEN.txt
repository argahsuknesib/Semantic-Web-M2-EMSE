Question 1 -->

The JSON-LD code described in the website is,

{
 "@context": "http://schema.org",
 "@type": "Organization",
 "@id": "https://www.discogs.com/label/41291-Semantic",
 "name": "Semantic",
 "image": "https://img.discogs.com/mppPGlkRSJBQ7VbOokpY9G7kC4g=/fit-in/249x77/filters:strip_icc():format(jpeg):mode_rgb():quality(90)/discogs-images/L-41291-1578737977-3558.png.jpg",

",
 "Offers": {
  "@type": "AggregateOffer",
  "availability": "http://schema.org/InStock",
  "offerCount": 1336
 }
}

The entity described is an Organization (noted from "@type") with the name Semantic. This particular entity is further described
using the "description" attribute of the mentioned JSON-LD. 

Question 2 -->

The JSON-LD described is,

"@context": "http://schema.org/",
    "@type": "Product",
    "name": "AMD Ryzen 3 1200 AF Wraith Stealth Edition (3.1 GHz / 3.4 GHz)",
        "image": "https://media.ldlc.com/r1600/ld/products/00/05/66/87/LD0005668738_1.jpg",
        "description": "The AMD Ryzen 3 1200 AF is AMD&#039;s affordable quad-core processor: 3.1 GHz 3.4 GHz, 8MB L3 cache and only 65W TDP! It will allow you to equip your machine with a powerful Quad-Core processor for an incredible performance/price ratio.",
    "mpn": "YD1200BBAFBOX",
    "sku": "AR202003200050",
    "brand": {
        "@type": "Thing",
        "name": "AMD"
    },
    "aggregateRating": {
        "@type": "AggregateRating",
        "ratingValue": "10",
        "reviewCount": "6",
        "bestRating": "10",
        "worstRating": "0"
    },
    "offers": {
        "@type": "Offer",
        "priceCurrency": "EUR",
        "availability": "http://schema.org/OutOfStock",
        "itemCondition": "http://schema.org/NewCondition",
        "price": "89.95",
        "url": "https://www.ldlc.com/en/product/PB00337308.html"
    }

Yes we can decide the availability of the product by
looking at the JSON-LD of the page source.By viewing the attribute "availability" we can find
it to be "http://schema.org/OutOfStock" and if it is 
back in stock the availability attribute will change to "https://schema.org/InStock"

Question 3 -->

The JSON-LD of the page source is,

Question 2 -->

In the RDF above, the link to be made a real world IRI and not string is to be done by adding an "@id" : "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYThjYzcyYzItNTVjNy00NDk0LTgwMWQtYjMwNmNlNWJhMzMyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg"
to the link for the image to make it an IRI.
