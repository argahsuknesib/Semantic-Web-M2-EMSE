Question 1 -->

The JSON-LD code described with an example context (let's use Schema.org)
is,

{

  "@context": {
      "ref" : "https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q13912",
      "publisher" : "https://schema.org/publisher",
      "publicationDate": "https://schema.org/Date",
      "title": "https://schema.org/ScholarlyArticle",
      "usefulLinks" : "https://schema.org/url"
  },

  "ref": "Q13912",

  "publisher": "Harper & Raw",

  "publicationDate": "1963-11-13",

  "title": "Where the Wild Things Are",

  "usefulLinks": [ "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_the_Wild_Things_Are" ]

}


Question 2 -->

I think for it to be semantically equal to this,
I will have to use wikidata, purl and xmlns than just 
using Schema like I did before,

I wil write the JSON-LD code again with context,

{
  
  "@context": {
      "ref" : "https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q13912",
      "publisher": "http://purl.org/dc/terms/publisher",
      "issued": "http://purl.org/dc/terms/issued",
      "title" : "http://purl.org/dc/terms/title",
      "usefulLinks" : "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/isPrimarySubjectOf"

  },


  "ref": "Q13912",

  "publisher": "Harper & Raw",

  "publicationDate": "1963-11-13",

  "title": "Where the Wild Things Are",

  "usefulLinks": [ "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_the_Wild_Things_Are" ]

}


Notes : 

You can use both @id and @type (for the literal) for the context used
in the JSON-LD context, the type can be either an url or whatever comes after this.

:b0 -> this is a blank node. if you will draw this as a graph you
will not find a issues or different values related to it or something
@base -> is required to provide the base URL to the entities.
