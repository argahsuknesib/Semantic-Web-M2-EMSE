Regarding the current contracting phase (as described in question 2)

<-- the agentâ€™s autonomy of the giacomo agent and of the company agents -->
The pros are : 
1. Giacomo agent has more autonomy and as it is the owner, it can now decide which
particular company should work for a particular task in house building.
2. Companies are not participating in the bidding of the tasks they are not able to do
which makes the process more efficient.

The cons are :
1. As the present implementation doesn't provide record of the trust and reputation
as well as the average time taken for a particular company to build the house 
it is not implementation.

2. The coordination in execution can be affected by efficiency of each company.
For example, it is useless if the company responsible to make the base takes a lot of time
even if it is cheap (as preferred by the artifact) because it will hault other work such
as the agent responsible to build the roof.

<-- the openness of the system, considering that agents supporting the companies may
 be developed by any company and join the "market place" to participate to the auctions -->

The pros are :
1. Giacomo agent can now choose the new company if it enters based upon the work it can do.
2. Giacomo agent has more options to chose from the presented profile.
3. Only the companies with an invitation can participate, increasing the efficiency of 
computation. We can add more companies to the system and can keep them on 'no communication'
based interaction if they don't do the work giacomo agent wants, and can be utilized later.
The cons are :
1. As the system doesn't consider the trust/reputation/average time taken to build for any company,
introducing new companies to the system can decrease efficiency.
