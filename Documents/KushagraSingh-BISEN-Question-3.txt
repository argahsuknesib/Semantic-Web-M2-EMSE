Regarding the current contracting phase (as described in question 3)

<-- the agentâ€™s autonomy of the giacomo agent and of the company agents -->
The pros are : 
1. The giacomo agent's logic to execute efficient bidding and execution are the best of the
three stages as it can now both assign/chose specific tasks but also has the reputation
for the different companies. It can now choose the one with the best reputation and 
invite them for bidding for efficient execution.

The cons are :
1. Reputation is not calculated by running the simulation multiple times.
Instead, to simplify it is provided as a belief.

<-- the openness of the system, considering that agents supporting the companies may
 be developed by any company and join the "market place" to participate to the auctions -->

The pros are :
1. Any new company joining will need to have a reputation, which will help the 
giacomo agent to decide which company it should invite to bid for a task.

The cons are :
1. Interaction between different companies while execution, if implemented would be
making the process more efficient.
